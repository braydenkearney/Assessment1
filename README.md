<h1 style="border: 2px solid Tomato;">PERSONAL BACKROUND</h1>
<p>My name is Brayden and I was born and raised in Queensland, Australia. My education to date is the completion of high school. Introduction to IT and introduction to programming are my first studies upon leaving highschool. I have just recently returned from a two year working holiday in Canada in the rocky mountains. In the winter I worked as a lift operator and in the summer I worked as a server. An interesting fact about me is that i'm obsessed with all board sports; snowboarding, skateboarding and surfboarding. </p>

<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">INTEREST IN IT</h1>
<p>Being born into the 21st century I have grown up with evolving technology all around me. So given that it would be hard not to be interested in it. Some of my many interests in IT include; gaming, video editing and social media such as Instagram to post my travels and adventures.</p>

<p>From a very young age I was interested in IT. My earliest memories were playing on my grandparents Nintendo 64 occasionally when visiting them. Then as I got a little older playing on the Playstation 1 with my Dad. This is where the sparks really started, playing Crash Bandicoot and Tony Hawk's Pro skater. My interest continued to grow with the always evolving technology in my life. I remember the Christmas when the first Nintendo Wii came out begging my parents for one. This was my first time interacting and using a wireless controller that has a pointer and detects motion. This interest in gaming has stayed with me to date, currently I game on my Xbox 1, playing games like Call of duty.</p>

<p>My official IT experience is little to none. In grades 11 and 12 I studied an IT course for one of my subjects. In this course we learnt very basic website design, basic code language and basic games design using Scratch. Other than that my IT experience only includes self teaching, for example teaching myself how to edit videos. </p>

<p>I chose to study intro to programming and intro to IT at RMIT because I thoroughly enjoyed studying IT at school and wanted to further develop this interest as a possible career path. I believe that IT will be an always changing and ever growing aspect in human life, therefore as a career it would be interesting and as an individual you would always be learning. I chose RMIT through open universities Australia upon my return from Canada because I thought it was time to expand on my interests in IT.</p>

<p>I expect to learn a very broad idea of what IT is and grasp a basic concept of some code language. I expect to be prepared and setup for my bachelor of IT which I will study at RMIT after my courses. I also expect to learn about potential jobs in the world of IT and even possibly discover what career path would interest me. </p>

<h1 style="border:2px solid Pink;">IDEAL JOB</h1>

<p>The job I found is an IT security specialist based where I live, which I found on Indeed.<p>


<img src="IMAGES/it1.png" alt="job" width="300" height="333">
<p>An IT security specialist’s main job is to defend an organization's information systems. This can include tasks like preventing cyber attacks by installing security software, monitoring and protecting against security breaches and countering cyber attacks. One of the reasons this type of position seems appealing to me is because during this pandemic and currently being not employed, it has really made me question what work is essential. I believe that cyber security will always be something that is essential and will always have a demand from organizations. Another key reason is that cyber security is in high demand across all organizations from; corporations, government agencies, schools, universities and  medical practices. In today's society with IT growing everyday and storage of data in the cloud becoming more popular I feel that cyber security is more important than ever.<p>
  
<p>To become an IT security specialist it is required that a student has studied cyber security and IT skills that include; IT fundamentals, cloud security, cryptography, network security, database security, ethics for IT professionals, and project management. It is also important that they understand programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and PHP. The qualifications include at least Bachelor's level or higher qualification in Information Technology and Formal IT Security qualifications recognised by the Australia Computer Society. As well as all this, most employers require that you have problem solving skills, critical thinking skills and communication skills. This is because security specialist’s must explain complex IT issues in basic terms to help managers make decisions.<p>

<p>Currently in relation to IT I have very basic skills and experience and no qualifications. My experience in IT comes from many years of using the devices I own such as; laptops, Iphones and gaming devices. This experience is mostly only handy for my everyday leisure. Some basic IT skills that I have self taught are in video editing. I have learnt skills such as; cutting, cropping, speed editing, sound editing, transitional editing, importing and exporting.<P>

<p>I plan to obtain the skills needed by passing my current two courses Introduction to Programming and Introduction to IT. Then I plan to continue on my path towards obtaining my bachelor of IT. I also plan on doing a more indepth course focused on cyber security.<p>
