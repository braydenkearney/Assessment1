<h2>PERSONAL BACKROUND</h2>
<p>My name is Brayden and I was born and raised in Queensland, Australia. My education to date is the completion of high school. Introduction to IT and introduction to programming are my first studies upon leaving highschool. I have just recently returned from a two year working holiday in Canada in the rocky mountains. In the winter I worked as a lift operator and in the summer I worked as a server. An interesting fact about me is that i'm obsessed with all board sports; snowboarding, skateboarding and surfboarding. </p>
