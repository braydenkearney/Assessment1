<h1 style="border: 2px solid Tomato;">PERSONAL BACKROUND</h1>
<p>My name is Brayden and I was born and raised in Queensland, Australia. My education to date is the completion of high school. Introduction to IT and introduction to programming are my first studies upon leaving highschool. I have just recently returned from a two year working holiday in Canada in the rocky mountains. In the winter I worked as a lift operator and in the summer I worked as a server. An interesting fact about me is that i'm obsessed with all board sports; snowboarding, skateboarding and surfboarding. </p>

<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">INTEREST IN IT</h1>
<p>Being born into the 21st century I have grown up with evolving technology all around me. So given that it would be hard not to be interested in it. Some of my many interests in IT include; gaming, video editing and social media such as Instagram to post my travels and adventures.</p>

<p>From a very young age I was interested in IT. My earliest memories were playing on my grandparents Nintendo 64 occasionally when visiting them. Then as I got a little older playing on the Playstation 1 with my Dad. This is where the sparks really started, playing Crash Bandicoot and Tony Hawk's Pro skater. My interest continued to grow with the always evolving technology in my life. I remember the Christmas when the first Nintendo Wii came out begging my parents for one. This was my first time interacting and using a wireless controller that has a pointer and detects motion. This interest in gaming has stayed with me to date, currently I game on my Xbox 1, playing games like Call of duty.</p>

<p>My official IT experience is little to none. In grades 11 and 12 I studied an IT course for one of my subjects. In this course we learnt very basic website design, basic code language and basic games design using Scratch. Other than that my IT experience only includes self teaching, for example teaching myself how to edit videos. </p>

<p>I chose to study intro to programming and intro to IT at RMIT because I thoroughly enjoyed studying IT at school and wanted to further develop this interest as a possible career path. I believe that IT will be an always changing and ever growing aspect in human life, therefore as a career it would be interesting and as an individual you would always be learning. I chose RMIT through open universities Australia upon my return from Canada because I thought it was time to expand on my interests in IT.</p>

<p>I expect to learn a very broad idea of what IT is and grasp a basic concept of some code language. I expect to be prepared and setup for my bachelor of IT which I will study at RMIT after my courses. I also expect to learn about potential jobs in the world of IT and even possibly discover what career path would interest me. </p>

<h1 style="border:2px pink;">IDEAL JOB</h1>

<p>The job I found is an IT security specialist based where I live, which I found on Indeed.<p>
